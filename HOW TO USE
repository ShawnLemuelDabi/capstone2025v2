1. To run the scraper
py main.py

2. Extract the URLs from the csv output by scraper
py .\utils\url_extractor.py

3. To  run the downloader
py .\downloader\downloader.py

py .\downloader\invalid_video_checker.py

5.1 This is to extract frames and create more positive and negative examples for the actor screen time model training.
THIS IS ONLY DONE WHEN NECESSARY TO INCREASE MODEL ACCURACY

When running it please select
C:\Users\shann\PycharmProjects\capstone2025V2\content_analysers\actor_screen_time\model_trainer\positive_videos
or
C:\Users\shann\PycharmProjects\capstone2025V2\content_analysers\actor_screen_time\model_trainer\negative_videos
according to how you want to train the model. (do adjust the directories based on your file structure)

py .\content_analysers\actor_screen_time\frames_extractor.py

5.2 This is to sequence the frames properly. Do it for both positive and negative frames
py .\content_analysers\actor_screen_time\frames_sequencer.py

5.3 This is to generate the training mapping csv
py .\content_analysers\actor_screen_time\mapping_csv_editor.py

5.4 Feed the videos through actor screen time model, select the training data
Change actor_sceen_time.py line 130 to the correct output directory
py .\content_analysers\actor_screen_time\actor_screen_time.py

6. Feed the videos through sentiment analysis
py .\content_analysers\sentiment_analysis\sentiment_analysis.py

7. This is the CSV Merger workflow
7.1 Check that the correct CSV files are selected for merging
py .\csv_merger\csv_merger.py
7.2 select the correct merged file and apply the refinements
py .\csv_merger\csv_refiner.py

8. Extract the themes from the captions column of the generated CSV data
8.1 pip install space==3.5.0 (because this is the version compatible with python 3.8.2 and other existing libraries)
py .\theme_extractor\theme_extractor.py

8.2 Use NotebookLM to assign topics to the CSV
